        </p>
        <p>To whom it may concern, I am currently looking for a position at your organization.</p>
        <p>I can if required manage the business requirements, definition, design, analysis, testing and debugging of the organization's ERP to support core business functions (Human Resources, Payroll, General Financials, Supply Chain, and Accounts Payable). I have experience creating accounting systems from scratch and producing all the financials, invoices, purchase orders, user interfaces, reports including Supply Chain utilization, Accounts Payable discount and rebate reports and customer service satisfaction reports. My experience with Payroll and Human Resources are as a business owner.</p>
        <p>I have owned four companies: a type of small bank, a wholesale foliage, an advertising company and a software company. They each had a separate set of employees thus my Human Resources and payroll experience is relevant as well as my knowledge of running different types of independent companies. I ran 3 privately owned companies and at the same time I was helping Dade Behring become a $1 Billion dollar company by working in the Global Logistics Department(a 4 person group who coordinated the entire business activities of the merged companies under direct supervision of the CEO and VPs) consolidating merged companies and repairing their broken out of control inventory problem by figuring out how to solve the issue that was sending them into bankruptcy thus turning them into a profitable business instead of closing. Each of the merged companies had a problem that had to be solved in order to make them profitable. </p>
        <p>In fact, Jimmy Delaney, a Baptist Health South Florida Pharmacist used to work for me for over 10 years before he went to work for Baptist. I had numerous hourly employees paid well enough to own their own homes and attend college or in some cases a local community outreach center in Homestead, FL that taught migrants to read, write and speak English as well as earn a diploma.</p>
        <p>I can assist in defining functional requirements and system interfaces, assess available technologies, develop programs, present architecture/software designs in order to implement large projects to improve system efficiency, usability, and effectiveness because I have extensive experience consolidating, merging IT departments and companies as well as writing complete full stack applications from scratch from hardware design, database design to software design, writing the code and implementing. My past business ownership experience makes me perfect to Act as an internal consultant providing technical guidance and business process expertise to realize industry best practices, long-term economic viability, and workspace development with a focus on clinical and service excellence.  I will provide guidance, specialized technical and business knowledge to developers, analysts, users, and PeopleSofdt process owners.  I have extensive business experience that I can rely on that relies on extensive experience and judgement to plan and accomplish goals both as a business owner and past employee of a $1 Billion conglomeration, Dade Behring.</p>

        <p>Autonomy and creativity is critical to analysis of the ERP's core business functions as the PeopleSoft system and other types of systems and its development is essential to the organization's long-term economic viability, workforce development, clinical and service excellence. I am perfect for this job.</p>
        <p>Here are my qualifications. Degrees: Bachelors and Associates Degrees in Computer Science means I'm thoroughly trained on process diagrams and controls. Also my many years as a business owner substitutes for a Masters MBA Degree. </p>
        <p>Additional Qualifications: BA degree in Computer Science, AA in Computer Science and a ton of relatd experience both as busines owner and employee at a $Billion conglomeration of a medical hospital manufacturing diagnostic equipment and controls entity. Education/experience requirements can be substituted with a Master's Degree and at least six years experience which I have.</p>
        <P>Candidate's experience should be focused on analysis and project management or what is available on site for managing employees as well as other related business functions and I have experience in all business functios including CEO. </p>
        <p>I know Oracle, Oracle Reports, Oracle Forms, and Oracle Database as well as Oracle VM with more than 6 years experience in Human Resources, payroll, and all the different business functions. I have more than 6 years of experience with Windows Operating systems and knowledge of fundamental network technologies as required; I have Cisco network equipement at my house and have been trained on configuring Cisco Networks. I know SSMS, SQL Service Manager Studio, Firewall maintenance, web site administration on linux and IIS. I have an AWS Cloud sample. </p>
        <p>PeopleSoft security administration is a plus however I have security administration experience on a wider variety of platforms including Linux, Windows, VMWare, Solaris and Oracle VM.</p>
        <p>I do posses strong project management skills and the ability to lead a team of developers and analysts on projects of varying complexity; this ability is exampled in my list of accomplishments on my resume as well as my additional experience as a business owner of several companies each with their set of employees.</p>
        <p>I am very self motivated and multi-task oriented with the ability to learn new concepts exampled on my long list of technologies each with their own set of concepts both new and old job requirements which I can and do acquire quickly.</p>
        <p>Within 1 month of working at Dade Behring I had solved a critical business mission problem; an out of control inventory problem that took Dade International out of bankruptcy and turned them into a cash pile for growth. With each merger taking only a few months to take place, and consolidate I had to be on top of what was happening and coordinate with the new IT departments and quickly assimilate their unique platforms, infrastructure and methods. </p>
        <p>In fact, I know how to take two totally different companies in the same line of business and audit the employee functions to make a map of each company structure that I can then streamline into a cohesive function removing duplicity and reducing cost. The same is true of the IT deparments not just general business departments such as customer service, HR, Inventory Management and accounting. I have the excellent written and verbal communication skills with the ability to convey technical information, decisions and approaches to non-technical audiences.</p>
        <p>I have experience giving presentations, being in large conference meetings and strategic planning meetings where we hae a goal and create a straw man that we can pull apart and put back together till its exactly what we want and then move with that straw man to a completed goal able to adjust if needed on the way with entire companies involved. </p>
        <p>Call me at your earliest convenience to discuss employment at 786 519 4580. </p>
        <br><p>Warmest Regards, Shirley Nelson</p>
