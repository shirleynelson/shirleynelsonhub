        <p>Using Oracle Forms, Reports, PLSQL and Oracle Database on Windows, wrote a full stack GL with AR, AP, invoicing, purchase order, Supply Chain Inventory.        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p>I worked as a temporary consultant for a man named Mr. Sterns in his livingroom at his Ranch home near Plantation, FL. The application was done for a company called 6L's in Immokolee, FL.        <a href="#top">Top</a></p>

        <p>Saved $100 million in cost reduction with strategic forecast business intelligence reports.         <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
        <p>I was on the team that consolidated Dade International, Baxter Diagnostics, and Behring. I created Dade Behring’s Consolidated $1 Billion Chart of Accounts, consolidated the IT systems across the different companies, and was the business intelligence that allowed these mergers. I also reviewed the merger contract between Dade and Behring and spotted a hidden line that made Dade International a silent partner which I removed giving the full power of the corporations merged to Dade International.          <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
         <p id="Bain">Bain Capital's investment in Dade Behring represented a significant investment in the medical diagnostics industry. In 1994, Bain, together with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners completed a carveout acquisition of Dade International,[65] the medical diagnostics division of Baxter International in a $440 million acquisition. Dade's private equity owners merged the company with DuPont's in vitro diagnostics business in May 1996 and subsequently with the Behring Diagnostics division of Hoechst AG in 1997.[66] Aventis, the successor of Hoechst, acquired 52 percent of the combined company.[67] In 1999, the company reported $1.3 billion of revenue and completed a $1.25 billion leveraged recapitalization that resulted in a payout to shareholders.[66] The dividend, taken together with other previous shareholder dividends resulted in an eightfold return on investment to Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs.[33][54] “ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain_Capital#1990s

                <p id="rsupply">Excess and Obsolete Reports and other critical Supply Chain Analysis reports.
                  <br> Created an interrum data ware house solution for the migration of systems from all the different IT departments across the world to give critical consolidated and unconsolidated data reports and functions continued use between migration. Consolidated Dade Behrings Chart of Accounts across all merged cmpanies for use in their SAP conversion from PRMS and the rest of the computer departments from all the different merged companies such as Dupont Diagnostics, Behring and the different individual IT departments from Baxter and Dade International. Discerned which data need to be ported from what area for the SAP to PRMS migration. PRMS was on AS400s. Using my interumm data warehouse I could provide ultra accurate true to real time market data comparison forecasts, Excess and Obsolete Reports and made hundreds of reports utilized by everyone from supervisors on the ground floor to managers to directors and to the VPs and CEO. Yes, even Bain Capital. But I was the only person who understood how all the data could be pulled and summarized to become a critical accurate data warehouse with a Business Intelligence functionality that surpassed all other Business Intelligence Tools. The complexity of my data and reports made this activity critical to these merged companies so we could have accurate information and pull them out of bankruptcy.  Nobody else understood this. They thought I was making simple reports but it was far more complicated than a simple clerical job. My coworkers were not computer literate and the IT Departments were too focused on each of their departments. My integrated data warehouse with usable data spotted illicit activity,  gave more accurate information than the individual computer departments could produce and with a good real picture of all the companies a turn around was made possible to bring them out of bankruptcy. My coworkers didn't know how to use an Excel spreadsheet other than to add numbers and even a formula required my assistance. Same was true of MSProject. I gave them tips like use MSProject for their grand merger. But they had a ton of experience in manufacturing. I was the only person on the team leading the consolidations that knew anything about technology. The other VPS of IT quit and the managers layed off as John Doherty took the helm and reduced costs by letting people go to give the companies time to recover from near bankruptcy which my soltion(fix of the out of control inventory) was my data warehouse to such an extent that the giant IT departments were not being used to provide the critical supply chain information to run the company. It was all comping from me. And that is why I could uncover illicit activty. My database was detailed enough to produce any critical information and complex diagnostic reports.
                  <br> Order processing analyst to make sure customers received their product at 100 percent levels.
                  <br> Warehouse Inventory reports detailing customer service levels at all warehouse sites and excess obsolete numbers.
                  <br> Medical Blood Work and Controls Manufacturing reports were derived from my reports to give an extra quality assurance check to whatever the individual systems were reporting.
                  <br> Supply Chain Analysis reports of all sorts were created. I went to a meeting with 20 to 30 people on a long conference table and everyone there had a report from me instead of their computer generated reports from their individual systems.
                  <br> Warehouse Distribution Serving Levels reports showed utilization and highlighted excess breakage and turns.
                  <br> Medical Forecast Excess and Obsolete Reports. My reports were statistically compared against real time market data with forecast values and my values were almost identical to the forecasted market values to the point that the variations were insignificant. This analysis check was done by the R&D statiticians who worked on new product development and they had the highest attainable degrees in statistics to check my work and verify its accuracy.
                  <br> Created a consolidated $1 Billion Financial to see what all the merged companies financials would look like if merged.
                  <br> Created a $1 Billion plus Merger Consolidated Logistic reports including a report showing customers served and which customers purchased the least so they could be sold.
                  <br> Created other reports that showed product utilization so the ones not making enough could be sold.
                  <br> Created $1 Million plus Discount and Rebate reports based on breakage information or volume purchases. These are reports that would produce $1 Million or more in savings via a discount or rebate.

                <p id="mSAP">SAP had just been created. The top brass decided to consolidate all their merged companies data into one central computer center running PRMS in Deerfield, IL. I was on the Global Logistics team that consolidated the IT departments and data into a single location. We were a four person team. At the end they hired one ABOP programmer but he didn't  know how to use ABOP. I was the only technical person on the team. I recommended they keep the legacy systems temporarily while we only moved open orders to the SAP. At some point the legacy systems would not be needed and they could be dropped with all new orders being handled by SAP. I wrote the consolidated Chart of Accounts used on the SAP with a transaltion of the old individual merged company divisions chart of accounts mapped to the new chart of accounts. Their instaff accountants from the different companies proofed the chart of accounts I made; they had all said they didn't know how to make it so I made one for them to review. Even their hired consultants said it was too complicated but I easily solved each problem as they arose. My hand made inerrum data warehouse kept everything running without a hitch during the migration.
