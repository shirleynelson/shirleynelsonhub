        <p>I was on the team that consolidated Dade International, Baxter Diagnostics, and Behring. I created Dade Behringâ€™s Consolidated $1 Billion Chart of Accounts, consolidated the IT systems across the different companies, and was the business intelligence that allowed these mergers. I also reviewed the merger contract between Dade and Behring and spotted a hidden line that made Dade International a silent partner which I removed giving the full power of the corporations merged to Dade International.          <a href="#top">Top</a></p>
         <p id="Bain">Bain Capital's investment in Dade Behring represented a significant investment in the medical diagnostics industry. In 1994, Bain, together with Goldman Sachs Capital Partners completed a carveout acquisition of Dade International,[65] the medical diagnostics division of Baxter International in a $440 million acquisition. Dade's private equity owners merged the company with DuPont's in vitro diagnostics business in May 1996 and subsequently with the Behring Diagnostics division of Hoechst AG in 1997.[66] Aventis, the successor of Hoechst, acquired 52% of the combined company.[67] In 1999, the company reported $1.3 billion of revenue and completed a $1.25 billion leveraged recapitalization that resulted in a payout to shareholders.[66] The dividend, taken together with other previous shareholder dividends resulted in an eightfold return on investment to Bain Capital and Goldman Sachs.[33][54] â€œ https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bain_Capital#1990s
